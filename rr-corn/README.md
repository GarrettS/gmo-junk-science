#Study Review: Results of a 13 week safety assurance study with rats fed grain from glyphosate tolerant corn

##Overview
This is a **review** of Monsanto's study of a 13 week feeding study in rats with grain from Monsanto's Roundup Ready corn which is tolerant to the herbicide glyphosate. 

Herbicide tolerance was accomplished through the introduction of [CP4 EPSPS](http://www.cera-gmc.org/GmCropDatabaseEvent/NK603) coding sequences into the corn genome for *in planta* production of CP4 EPSPS enzymes. Unlike related corn EPSPS enzymes, CP4 EPSPS enzymes are not inhibited by the herbicide glyphosate. 

##Problems
* The study is conducted by Monsanto.
* Half of the rats in the study groups were omitted from some of the tests. 
* Elsevier. Monsanto has a close relationship with Elsevier ([Richard Goodman](http://www.elsevier.com/journals/food-and-chemical-toxicology/0278-6915/editorial-boardrichard-goodman)). 
* The study is too short. It should be two years, not 13 weeks.
* Half of the rats in the study group were untested. 
* The diminished study groups (what was left of them) were too small to indicate statistical significance.* 
* Doesn't test the RR corn treated with Roundup vs without.
* Says glyphosate was below detection limits (250 ppb), defying [T. BÃ¸hn, et al](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308814613019201) (Glyphosate accumulates in Roundup Ready GM soybeans).
* Doesn't test for AMPA (glyphosate byproduct) or [POEA](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/weed-whacking-herbicide-p/) (toxic adjuvant in Roundup).
* References section for Monsanto links to [Monsanto's financial reports](http://www.monsanto.com/monsanto/content/investor/financial/reports) (this link is now broken). Why? Is this study for our health or for trade deals?
* Discussion section rationalizes about GATT. What's the relation to the outcome of this study?
