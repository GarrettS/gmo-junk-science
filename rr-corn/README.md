#Study Review: Results of a 13 week safety assurance study with rats fed grain from glyphosate tolerant corn

##Overview
This is a **review** of Monsanto's study of a 13 week feeding study in rats with grain from Monsanto's Roundup Ready corn which is tolerant to the herbicide glyphosate. 

Herbicide tolerance was accomplished through the introduction of [CP4 EPSPS](http://www.cera-gmc.org/GmCropDatabaseEvent/NK603) coding sequences into the corn genome for *in planta* production of CP4 EPSPS enzymes. Unlike related corn EPSPS enzymes, CP4 EPSPS enzymes are not inhibited by the herbicide glyphosate. 

##Problems
* The study is conducted by Monsanto.
* Half of the rats in the study groups were omitted from some of the tests. 
* Elsevier. Monsanto has a close relationship with Elsevier (Richard Goodman)
* The study is too short. It should be two years, not 13 weeks.
* The diminished study groups (what was left of them) were too small to indicate statistical significance
* Doesn't test the corn treated with roundup vs without
* references section for Monsanto links to [Monsanto's financial reports](http://www.monsanto.com/monsanto/content/investor/financial/reports) (this link is now broken)
* Discussion section rationalizes about GATT and percentage of this corn that is anticipated for EU food supply (what's the relation to the outcome of this study?)
