#Study Review: Results of a 13 week safety assurance study with rats fed grain from glyphosate tolerant corn

##Overview
This is a **review** of Monsanto's 13 week feeding study in rats with grain from Monsanto's Roundup Ready corn which is tolerant to the herbicide glyphosate. 

Herbicide tolerance was accomplished through the introduction of [CP4 EPSPS](http://www.cera-gmc.org/GmCropDatabaseEvent/NK603) coding sequences into the corn genome for *in planta* production of CP4 EPSPS enzymes. Unlike related corn EPSPS enzymes, CP4 EPSPS enzymes are not inhibited by the herbicide glyphosate. 

##Concerns
* The study was paid for by Monsanto and conducted by Monsanto employees, which is a potential conflict of interest.
* Half of the rats in the study groups were omitted from some of the tests. Why? What happened to them?
* Elsevier. Monsanto has a close relationship with Elsevier ([Richard Goodman](http://www.elsevier.com/journals/food-and-chemical-toxicology/0278-6915/editorial-boardrichard-goodman)). 
* The study is too short. It should be two years, not 13 weeks.
* The diminished study groups (what was left of them) were too small to indicate statistical significance. [P-value](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value) for a group of 4-6 is too high and a [type-II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors) error is likely.
* Doesn't test the Roundup Ready corn treated with Roundup vs without Roundup.
* Glyphosate & [AMPA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMPA_receptor) residues are unknown. They say the corn was sprayed with Roundup, yet glyphosate was below detection limits (250 ppb). The methodology used to detect residues is undisclosed and that result is questionable.
* The control diet, [Purina LabDiet 5002](http://www.labdiet.com/cs/groups/lolweb/@labdiet/documents/web_content/mdrf/mdi4/~edisp/ducm04_028003.pdf), is made mainly from corn and soy that has been [genetically modified](http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Robin_Mesnage/publication/263696636_Letter_to_the_Editor_regarding_Delaney_et_al._2014_Uncontrolled_GMOs_and_their_associated_pesticides_make_the_conclusions_unreliable/links/0f31753bacbf7ce778000000). 
* Doesn't test for AMPA (glyphosate byproduct) or [POEA](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/weed-whacking-herbicide-p/) (toxic adjuvant in Roundup).
* References section for Monsanto links to [Monsanto's financial reports](http://www.monsanto.com/monsanto/content/investor/financial/reports) (this link is now broken). Why? Is this study for our health or for trade deals?
* Discussion section rationalizes about [GATT](http://www.gatt.org/). What's the relation to the outcome of this study?
